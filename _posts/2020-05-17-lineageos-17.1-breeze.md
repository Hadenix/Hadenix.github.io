LineageOS 17.0 for the UMIDIGI A5 Pro, with things mostly working as they are expected to. This ROM depends on the official vendor image, so please be sure you are on the latest official build before flashing this ROM onto your device. Also, since these MTK devices often come with some strange variants, please be aware that your lineage may vary.

### What's working

* RIL (Calls, SMS, Data)
* Wi-Fi
* Access point
* Bluetooth
* Audio
* Sensors
* Flash
* GPS

### Known issues
* VoLTE does not work (and probably won't work on any MTK device with custom ROMs any time soon) due to MTK's proprietary extensions.
