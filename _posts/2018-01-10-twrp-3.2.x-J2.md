### Installation
1. Before twrp firmware, unlock the OEM bootloader in the developer options.
How to enter the developer mode: Go to Settings-About device-Software information and tap 5 times on "Build number", now the "Developer options" item will appear in the settings
2. Enter firmware mode
a) Turn off the phone
b) Clamp together the three buttons on the phone, press and hold in turn: the volume down button, the home button and the power button, as soon as the phone enters the firmware mode (green screen, where warning will be written and something else), release all the buttons and press the volume up button (warning screen changes to downloading), we are all on the main screen of the firmware mode.
c) Launch Odin. We select the archive with twrp in Odin, in the AP window (make sure that the check mark is checked), on the left in Odin there is a log window, above it there are three log, options, pit tabs, click the options tab and turn off Auto Reboot (uncheck)
d) Connect the phone to the PC using the cable and click on Odin "Start"
e) As soon as the archive firmware process is completed, disconnect the phone from the PC, because we have disabled the auto reboot function, the phone will still be on the firmware mode screen and to enter TWRP we press one by one and hold the volume up button, the home button and button power, hold all these buttons together for a few seconds, a reboot will occur, as soon as the SAMSUNG logo appears, release the power button, and hold the volume up and home buttons until the phone enters TWRP
