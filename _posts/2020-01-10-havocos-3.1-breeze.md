**Havoc-OS** 2.x is based on AOSP, inspired by Google Pixel. Has a refined Material Design 2 UI by @SKULSHADY. So many features that you probably won't find in any ROM. All you can dream of and all you'll ever need.
Just flash and enjoy...

### What's working
* Boots
* RIL (Calls, SMS, Data)
* Wi-Fi
* Access point
* Bluetooth
* Video Playback
* Audio
* Sensors
* Flash
* GPS
* Fingerprint
* Camera

### Known issues
* VoLTE does not work (and probably won't work on any MTK device with custom ROMs any time soon) due to MTK's proprietary extensions.
* Sometimes data connection can be randomly lost during reconnections. This can be fixed by either a reboot or `pkill phone` in a root shell (terminal).
* Video animation like on Treble (GSI).
* Offline charging.
* Wide angle module.
